I've noticed when opening a Chrome desktop shortcut to YNABn it may not show some of the features of the toolkit. Seems the Chrome browser needs to be opened first then the shortcut, otherwise leave the shortcut alone and open in the newly opened browser. It's not an issue as it seems the shortcut is frozen to a previous version of Toolkit if opened before the browser with the toolkit extension. Please let coders know as this can be a question to those experiencing toolkit issues.
